# Titanic
Predict survival of passengers in test set
Dataset taken from Kaggle

Currently just exploring testset using python and R


Variables  
1. survival --> Survival	--> 0 = No, 1 = Yes
2. pclass	--> Ticket class	--> 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
3. sex	--> Sex  --> female,male	
4. Age	--> Age in years	
5. sibsp	--> # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
6. parch	--> # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
7. ticket	--> Ticket number	
8. fare	--> Passenger fare	
9. cabin	--> Cabin number	
10. embarked	--> Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton


## *Variable Notes*

### pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)

1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower

### age: Age is fractional if less than 1. 

If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

### sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister

Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

### parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Parent = mother, father

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.


## **First Attempt** 

On training set.

### **Logistic regression**

y = ['Survived']

X = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare',
       'Embarked']
       
**Results**

confusion matrix =

[140  25]

[ 34  69]
